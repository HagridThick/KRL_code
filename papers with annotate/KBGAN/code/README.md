## Dependencies
* Python 3
* PyTorch 0.2.0
* PyYAML
* nvidia-smi

**PyTorch 0.2.0 is REQUIRED**. Because PyTorch is not backward compatible, **newer versions will NOT work**. We understand that 0.2.0 is outdated, but we currently have no schedule of adding support to newer PyTorch versions.

## Usage
1. Unzip `data.zip`.
2. Pretrain: `python3 pretrain.py --config=config_<dataset_name>.yaml --pretrain_config=<model_name>` (this will generate a pretrained model file)
2. Adversarial train: `python3 gan_train.py --config=config_<dataset_name>.yaml --g_config=<G_model_name> --d_config=<D_model_name>` (make sure that G model and D model are both pretrained)

Feel free to explore and modify parameters in config files. Default parameters are those used in experiments reported in the paper.

Decrease `test_batch_size` in config files if you experience GPU memory exhaustion. (this would make the program runs slower, but would not affect the test result)
